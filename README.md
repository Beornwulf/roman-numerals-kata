# Roman Numerals Kata

Done as a recorded exercise for [TechReturners](https://www.techreturners.com/), following the kata
at [CodingDojo](https://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/).

The priority here was to practice TDD, and the red-green-refactor cycle.

## Notes

As the explanatory link from the CodingDojo site was not simple to parse, I chose to follow the "standard form" of Roman
Numerals as defined on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Standard_form):

|     | Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Units |
|:---:|:----------|:---------|:-----|:------|
|  1  | M         | C        | X    | I     |
|  2  | MM        | CC       | XX   | II    |
|  3  | MMM       | CCC      | XXX  | III   |
|  4  |           | CD       | XL   | IV    |
|  5  |           | D        | L    | V     |
|  6  |           | DC       | LX   | VI    |
|  7  |           | DCC      | LXX  | VII   |
|  8  |           | DCCC     | LXXX | VIII  |
|  9  |           | CM       | XC   | IX    |
